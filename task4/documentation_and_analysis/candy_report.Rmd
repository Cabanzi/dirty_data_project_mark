##Introduction to the Dataset

In this project, I analyzed a dataset containing candy ratings from 2015 to 2017. The dataset includes information on candy ratings from various countries, with columns representing different attributes such as country, candy type, and ratings.

##Assumptions

* The rating values provided in the dataset are accurate and represent the true feelings of the particpant.
* The dataset represents a random and unbiased sample of candy ratings from different countries.


## Cleaning the data

The first thing I did to clean the data was to make 3 individual csv files. 

* For each of these files I did the following:
* Added a "year" column 
* Created an age column. I set a limit of 116 (The age of the worlds oldest person as of 04/23)
* I standardised the country column so that their were not multiple names of the same country. 
* I then shifted through all the candy names so that they were properly labeled and removed anything that I did not feel was candy. I used google to verify the results.
